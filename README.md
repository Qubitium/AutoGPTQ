## How is AutoGPTQ-NEXT different from AutoGPTQ?

AutoGPTQ-NEXT is an opinionated fork/refractor of AugtoGPTQ with latest bug fixes applied, new features, better/latest model support, and a pledge from the ModelCloud.ai team and that we, along with the open-source ML community, will take every effort to bring the library up-to-date with latest advancements, model support, and bug fixes.

## Mission Statement

We want AutoGPTQ-NEXT to be highy focused on GPTQ based quantization and target inference compatibility with HF Transformers, vLLM, and SGLang. 

## Major Changes vs AutoGPTQ

* `Sym=False` Support. AutoGPTQ main has broken `sym=false`.
* `lm_head` module quantized inference support for further vram reduction.
* ChatGLM Model Support.
* Better defaults resulting in faster inference.
* Better default PPL with tweaked internal code (Result may vary depending on calibration set and gpu usage).
* Removed non-working, partially working, or fully deprecated features: Peft, ROCM, AWQ Gemm inference, Triton v1 (replaced by v2), Fused Attention (Replaced by Marlin/Exllama).
* Fixed Packing Performance regression on high core-count systems.
* Thousands of lines of refractor/cleanup.
* Debloated 271K lines of which 250K was caused by a single dataset used only by an example. Move dataset to HF.
* Shorter and more concise public api/internal vars. No need to copy bloated HF style for class names. 
* Complete tests with every feature and model tested. Everything that does not pass tests will be removed from repo. We want quality over quantity.

## Roadmap (Target Date: July 2024):

* DBRX support.
* `lm_head` quantization support by integrating with Intel/Autoround.
* Customizable callback in Per-Layer quantization.
* Add Qbits (cpu inference) support from Intel/Qbits.
* Add back ROCM/AMD support once verything is validated.
* Store quant loss stat and apply diffs to new quant for quality control.
* Alert users of non-optimal calibration data. Almost all new-users get this part horribly wrong. 
* Add CI workflow for PRs.
* Add Tests for every single supported model.

## Platform Support
AutoGPTQ-NEXT is currently Linux only and requires Torch/Cuda capable GPU from NVIDIA. WSL on Windows should work as well. ROCM/AMD support will be re-added in a furture version after everything on ROCM has been validated. Only fully validated features will be re-added from the original AutoGPTQ repo. 

## Install

AutoGPTQ-NEXT is available for Linux only. You can install the latest stable release of AutoGPTQ from pip with pre-built wheels:

| CUDA version | Installation                                                                                      | Built against PyTorch |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| CUDA 12.1         | `pip install auto-gptq-next --no-build-isolation`                                                                            | 2.3.1+cu121           |


AutoGPTQ-NEXT does not support [Maxwell or lower](https://qiita.com/uyuni/items/733a93b975b524f89f46) GPUs.

### Install from source

Clone repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Qubitium/AutoGPTQ-NEXT.git && cd AutoGPTQ-NEXT
```

Compile:
```bash
pip install -vvv --no-build-isolation -e .
```

### Quantization and Inference

> warning: this is just a showcase of the usage of basic apis in AutoGPTQ-NEXT, which uses only one sample to quantize a much small model, quality of quantized model using such little samples may not good.

Below is an example for the simplest use of `auto_gptq_next` to quantize a model and inference after quantization:

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from auto_gptq_next import AutoGPTQNext, QuantizeConfig

pretrained_model_dir = "facebook/opt-125m"
quant_output_dir = "opt-125m-4bit"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_dir, use_fast=True)
calibration_dataset = [
    tokenizer(
        "The world is a wonderful place full of beauty and love."
    )
]

quant_config = QuantizeConfig(
    bits=4,  # 4-bit
    group_size=128,  # 128 is good balance between quality and performance
)

# load un-quantized model, by default, the model will always be loaded into CPU memory
model = AutoGPTQNext.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_dir, quant_config)

# quantize model, the calibration_dataset should be list of dict whose keys can only be "input_ids" and "attention_mask"
model.quantize(calibration_dataset)

# save quantized model
model.save_quantized(quant_output_dir)

# load quantized model to the first GPU
model = AutoGPTQNext.from_quantized(quant_output_dir, device="cuda:0")

# download quantized model from Hugging Face Hub and load to the first GPU
# model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(repo_id, device="cuda:0")

# inference with model.generate
print(tokenizer.decode(model.generate(**tokenizer("auto_gptq_next is", return_tensors="pt").to(model.device))[0]))

# or you can also use pipeline
# pipeline = TextGenerationPipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
# print(pipeline("auto-gptq is")[0]["generated_text"])
```

### How to Add Support for a New Model

Read the `auto_gptq_next/models/llama.py` code which explains in detail via comments how the model support is defined. Use it as guide to PR for to new models. Most models follow the same pattern.

### Evaluation on Downstream Tasks

You can use tasks defined in `auto_gptq_next.eval_tasks` to evaluate model's performance on specific down-stream task before and after quantization.

The predefined tasks support all causal-language-models implemented in [ðŸ¤— transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and in this project.

<summary>Below is an example to evaluate `EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b` on sequence-classification task using `cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual` dataset:</summary>

# note that max_new_tokens will be automatically specified internally based on given classes
print(task.run())

# self-consistency

            num_beams=3,
            num_return_sequences=3,
